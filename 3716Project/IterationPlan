Iteration plan


I was thinking we just take from our prioritized features list. 

First iteration would be either "Join Society" or "Create Society" as those are clearly the most important parts of the system. If there 
is time for more we will can possibly do more (doubt there will be extra time)

Second iteration would may be be events?
